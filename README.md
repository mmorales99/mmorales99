## WHO AM I?

I'm a student at [Universidad de Alicante (UA)](https://www.ua.es/ "La UA no actUA").  
Polyglota since I speak native spanish, valencia as my mother languaje and fluent english; I also write code in Java, C/C++, Python and some many others.
In the way of specialising on Artificial Intelligence, I have done some courses about CUDA, Artificial and Computericed Visión, and Development of Neural Networks using Tensorflow 2 in Python.

In a hacky way, I drive my own radio at my local spot. Nowadays, this station has a range of 50 meters, not kinda powerful.
I have been colaborating around 2 years in the IEEE Student branchs of [Univesidad Miguel Hernández](https://umh.es/ "umhuuuus") where we developed lots of interdisciplinary projects, since a [roomba](https://www.irobot.es/)-like robot to a [CubeSat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat)(never launched).

If your are looking for some developers for your team, you can finde me at [joppy.me](https://app.joppy.me/).
